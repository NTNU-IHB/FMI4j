 * are actually no algebraic loops when connecting FMUs together].

     * Ordered list of all state derivatives, in other words a list of ScalarVariable

     * derivative of a state shall not be exposed from the FMU, or if states are not
     * statically associated with a variable (due to dynamic state selection), then dummy
     * ScalarVariables have to be introduced, for example x[4], or
     * xDynamicStateSet2[5]. The ordering of the variables in this list is defined by the
     * exporting tool. Usually, it is best to order according to the declaration order of the
     * states in the source model, since then the <Derivatives> list does not change, if
     * the declaration order of states in the source model is not changed. This is e.g.
     * important for linearization, in order that the interpretation of the state vector does
     * not change for a re-exported FMU.]. The corresponding continuous-time states
     * are defined by attribute derivative of the corresponding ScalarVariable state
     * derivative element. [Note, higher order derivatives must be mapped to first order
     * derivatives but the mapping definition can be preserved due to attribute
     * derivative.
     * For Co-Simulation, element “Derivatives” is ignored if capability flag
     * providesDirectionalDerivative has a value of false, in other words cannot
     * be computed [which is the default. If an FMU supports both ModelExchange and
     * CoSimulation, then the “Derivatives” element might be present, since it is needed
     * for ModelExchange. If the above flag is set to false for the CoSimulation case,
     * then the “Derivatives” element is ignored for CoSimulation. If “inline integration” is
     * used for a CoSimulation slave, then the model still has continuous-time states and
     * just a special solver is used.
