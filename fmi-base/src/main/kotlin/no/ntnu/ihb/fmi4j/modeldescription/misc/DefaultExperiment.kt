/**
 * Provides default settings for the integrator, such as stop time and
 * relative tolerance.
 *
 * DefaultExperiment consists of the optional default start time, stop time, relative tolerance, and step size
 * for the first simulation run. A tool may ignore this information. However, it is convenient for a user that
 * startTime, stopTime, tolerance and stepSize have already a meaningful default value for the model at
 * hand. Furthermore, for CoSimulation the stepSize defines the preferred communicationStepSize.
