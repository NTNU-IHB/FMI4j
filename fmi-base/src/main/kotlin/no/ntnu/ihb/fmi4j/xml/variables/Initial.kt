 * Enumeration that defines how the variable is initialized. It is not allowed to provide a
 * value for initial if causality = "input" or "independent":
 * • = "exact": The variable is initialized with the start value (provided under Real,
 * Integer, Boolean, String or Enumeration).
 * • = "approx": The variable is an iteration variable of an algebraic loop and the
 * iteration at initialization starts with the start value.
 * • = "calculated": The variable is calculated from other categories during initialization.
 * It is not allowed to provide a “start” value.
 * If initial is not present, it is defined by the table below based on causality and
 * variability. If initial = exact or approx, or causality = ″input″ a start
 * value must be provided. If initial = calculated, or causality = ″independent″ it is
 * not allowed to provide a start value.
 * [The environment decides when to use the start value of a variable with causality =
 * ″input″. Examples: (a) automatic tests of FMUs are performed, and the FMU is tested
 * by providing the start value as constant input. (b) For a ModelExchange FMU, the
 * FMU might be part of an algebraic loop. If the input variable is iteration variable of this
 * algebraic loop, then initialization starts with its start value.].
 * If fmiSetXXX is not called on a variable with causality = ″input″ then the FMU must
 * use the start value as value of this input.
