/**
 * Enumeration that defines the time dependency of the variable, in other words it defines
 * the time instants when a variable can change its value. [The purpose of this attribute is
 * to define when a result value needs to be inquired and to be stored. For example
 * discrete categories change their values only at event instants (ModelExchange) or at a
 * communication point (CoSimulation) and it is therefore only necessary to inquire them
 * with fmi2GetXXX and store them at event times]. Allowed values of this enumeration:
 * • "constant": The value of the variable never changes.
 * • "fixed": The value of the variable is fixed after initialization, in other words after
 * fmi2ExitInitializationMode was called the variable value does not change
 * anymore.
 * • "tunable": The value of the variable is constant between external events
 * (ModelExchange) and between Communication Points (CoSimulation) due to
 * changing categories with causality = "parameter" or "input" and
 * variability = "tunable". Whenever a parameter or input signal with
 * variability = "tunable" changes, then an event is triggered externally
 * (ModelExchange) or the change is performed at the next Communication Point
 * (CoSimulation) and the categories with variability = "tunable" and causality =
 * "calculatedParameter" or "output" must be newly computed.
 * • "discrete":
 * ModelExchange: The value of the variable is constant between external and internal
 * events (= time, state, step events defined implicitly in the FMU).
 * CoSimulation: By convention, the variable is from a “real” sampled data system and
 * its value is only changed at Communication Points (also inside the slave).
 * • "continuous": Only a variable of type = “Real” can be “continuous”.
 * ModelExchange: No restrictions on value changes.
 * CoSimulation: By convention, the variable is from a differential
 * The default is “continuous”.
 * [Note, the information about continuous states is defined with element
 * fmiModelDescription.ModelStructure.Derivatives]
